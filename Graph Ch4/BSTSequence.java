// BST SEQUENCE

// Given a binary tree with distinct elements, print all possible arrays
// that could have led to the tree

// HINT #39 - all arays must start with the root 
// HINT #48/#66 - they can be inserted however (right before left, left before right)
// HINT #82 - USE RECURSION





// Array must start with the root -> | root |   |   |   |   | 
// for all left and rigth subtrees, can be inserted in whichever order
// BINARY SEARCH TREES - LEFT ELEMENTS MUST BE LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO RIGHT ELEMENTS
// the order of left/right doesn't matter (directly below doesn't matter)
